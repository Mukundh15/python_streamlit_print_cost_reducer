# üßæ Advanced PDF Printing Cost Estimator

[](https://streamlit.io/)

An interactive web application built with Streamlit to analyze PDF files, estimate printing costs, and provide tools to reduce costs by selectively removing colors.

This tool goes beyond simple page counting by analyzing the pixel data of each page to differentiate between black & white, low-color, and high-color pages, providing a more accurate cost estimate.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Detailed Cost Breakdown**: Get estimates based on print type (color/B\&W), paper size (A4/A3), duplex printing, binding, and number of copies.
  * **Intelligent Color Analysis**: Automatically detects the amount of color on each page to provide a tiered cost structure.
  * **Advanced Color Removal**:
      * Use an interactive **color picker** to visually select specific colors to remove.
      * Manually input a list of hex codes for precise color removal.
      * Adjust the **sensitivity threshold** to control how closely a pixel must match to be removed.
  * **Cost & Ink Comparison**: Instantly see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs. modified PDF, including:
      * Total cost savings.
      * Percentage reduction in "ink" (non-white pixels).
  * **PDF Regeneration**: Download a new, optimized PDF with the selected colors removed.
  * **Actionable Suggestions**: Receive tips on how to further reduce costs, such as using duplex printing or switching to B\&W.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.

  * **Poppler**: `pdf2image` requires the Poppler utility. You must install it on your system.

      * **On macOS (using Homebrew):**
        ```bash
        brew install poppler
        ```
      * **On Ubuntu/Debian:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
        ```
      * **On Windows:**
        1.  [Download the latest Poppler binary for Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/).
        2.  Extract the archive (e.g., to `C:\poppler-22.04.0\`).
        3.  Add the `bin\` folder from the extracted archive (e.g., `C:\poppler-22.04.0\bin`) to your system's PATH.

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
streamlit
pdf2image
Pillow
numpy
```

### 4\. Run the Streamlit App

Once the dependencies are installed, run the application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should now be open and running in your web browser\!
