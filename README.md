# üßæ Advanced PDF Printing Cost Estimator

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://streamlit.io/)

An interactive web application built with Streamlit to analyze PDF files, estimate printing costs, and provide tools to reduce costs by selectively removing colors.

This tool goes beyond simple page counting by analyzing the pixel data of each page to differentiate between black & white, low-color, and high-color pages, providing a more accurate cost estimate.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Detailed Cost Breakdown**: Get estimates based on print type (color/B&W), paper size (A4/A3), duplex printing, binding, and number of copies.
- **Intelligent Color Analysis**: Automatically detects the amount of color on each page to provide a tiered cost structure.
- **Advanced Color Removal**:
  - Use an interactive **color picker** to visually select specific colors to remove.
  - Manually input a list of hex codes for precise color removal.
  - Adjust the **sensitivity threshold** to control how closely a pixel must match to be removed.
- **Cost & Ink Comparison**: Instantly see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs. modified PDF, including total cost savings and percentage reduction in "ink".
- **PDF Regeneration**: Download a new, optimized PDF with the selected colors removed.
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Receive tips on how to further reduce costs.
